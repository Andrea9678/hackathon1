# Community Pulse
Hackathon #1 Swag

#Introduction
The Idea behind Community Pulse(I know that's a cheeky name. Whatever fam) is to have a platform where peeps can a community driven story. i.e.

#Concept
- App Provides a brand driven initial message
- Community members(grouped off by interests) are allow to riff on the message once in ten turns
- Messages are compiled and turned into an immersive experience

#Example
- Initial messsge: "Kobe puts on a pair of nike sneakers"
- #UserID : Message
- #001 : He games the ball from Michael
- #002 : It was a cold cold night in toronto
- #003 : He felt the chill on the ball
- #004 : They shouldn't have been out that late
- #005 : But bet's a bet

# Launch The Experience
- Clone
- Npm install in terminal
- Run on IOS simulator or Android emulator
